# Arduino-Distance-Measurement-Using-Ultrasonic-Sensor-HC-SR04-and-LCD

In this video, I have created a *Distance Measurement System* using Arduino UNO, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, and an I2C LCD Display. This project accurately measures the distance to an object and displays the reading in both centimeters and inches!  *Components Used:* Arduino UNO HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor I2C 16x2 LCD Display Breadboard & Jumper Wires  *Project Features:* Real-time distance measurement Output in both CM and INCHES
